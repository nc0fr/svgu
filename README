Shared Vanity Go URLs (SVGU)
============================

SVGU is a quick and efficient solution tool to create and share Go modules on
your own domain.

For illustration, let take the Go module hosted on GitHub at
https://github.com/nc0fr/foo-go. Using SVGU, the module can be named using
my own domain (go.nc0.fr) and imported via go.nc0.fr/foo.


Getting started
---------------

You can install SVGU via Homebrew, using the Go toolchain, or compiling from
sources.

Homebrew:

    $ brew install nc0fr/nc0/svgu

Go:

    $ go install go.nc0.fr/svgu@latest

Compiling from sources (requires Go, Git and Make):

    $ git clone https://github.com/nc0fr/svgu.git
    $ cd svgu
    $ make

Please refer to the online documentation (https://svgu.nc0.fr) for more
information.
