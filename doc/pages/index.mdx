# Welcome to SVGU
 
**SVGU** (short for *shared vanity Go URLs*) is a neat command-line utility
that allows anyone to publish their Go modules on their own domains, to
obtain module names such as `example.com/foo` instead of `github.com`.

Naming a Go module using a custom domain name avoid being trapped to the code
hosting service (such as GitHub). Indeed, you could change the host used (or
change the origin used) without requiring your users to change all their code
to the new path.

For illustration, imagine you are using `example.com/foo` as a dependency,
whose main origin is on GitHub. If suddenly the origin is moved to GitLab
(for some particular reason), it will be transparent to you.
